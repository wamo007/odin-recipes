        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            No pizza oven? No problem! 
            Make your homemade pizza on the grill for that <em>classic</em> smoky, wood fired oven flavor. 
            And even if you have a pizza oven, you might prefer <strong>the grill</strong> from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>
            This grilled pizza is topped with tomato sauce, tomatoes, 
            black olives, roasted red peppers, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. 
            Of course, you can use <strong><em>whatever</em> toppings</strong> you like!
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
                <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. 
                    Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 
                    and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
                <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. 
                    Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: 
                    Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. 
                    Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
                <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. 
                    Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
                <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. 
                    Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. 
                    When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
                <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.</li>
                <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: 
                    tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.</li>
                <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. 
                    Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. 
                    Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
            </ol>
